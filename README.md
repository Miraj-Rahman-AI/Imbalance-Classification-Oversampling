# Imbalance Classification Oversampling

Imbalance Classification Oversampling is a comprehensive repository offering a suite of advanced resampling techniques specifically designed for tackling class imbalance issues in machine learning. Imbalanced datasets, which are common in real-world applications, can severely hinder the performance of machine learning models. This repository aims to address that by providing a variety of oversampling methods that help balance the data distribution, allowing models to learn from minority class data effectively and produce more reliable predictions.

The repository includes various **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique** (SMOTE) variants, along with additional oversampling strategies, API integrations, and flexible configuration options to suit a wide range of classification problems. Each technique has been crafted and optimized for different imbalance scenarios to ensure robustness and ease of integration into existing workflows.

## Introduction

Imbalanced data is a prevalent problem in machine learning and data science. When dealing with such data, models often show a bias toward the majority class and fail to learn the patterns of the minority class effectively. Oversampling techniques, like SMOTE, aim to resolve this by generating synthetic instances of the minority class, helping balance the dataset and improve model generalization.

This repository provides an extensive collection of oversampling methods designed to enhance the performance of classification models trained on imbalanced datasets. By using various SMOTE variants and other advanced oversampling techniques, this project empowers users to handle data imbalance issues more effectively, ensuring that models are trained on well-balanced datasets for more accurate predictions.

## Installation

To get started with using the techniques in this repository, follow the steps below to install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Imbalance-Classification-Oversampling.git

   cd Imbalance-Classification-Oversampling

pip install -r requirements.txt

from smote_variants_v3_GBsMote import GBSmote

# Step 1: Load your dataset (replace with your actual data loading process)
X, y = load_data()  # Example: X contains features, y contains labels

# Step 2: Apply G-SMOTE oversampling
smote = GBSmote()
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)  # Resample the data

# Step 3: Train your classifier using the resampled data
model = YourModel()  # Example: Replace with your classifier model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier)
model.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)  # Fit the model to the resampled data
